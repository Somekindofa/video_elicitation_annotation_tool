# Quick Start: Local Video Streaming for 11GB Video

## For Your Presentation Tomorrow 🎯

### Problem Solved
✅ No Google Drive space needed  
✅ 11GB video works perfectly  
✅ Zero upload time (instant registration)  
✅ Professional HTTP streaming (like YouTube)

---

## Setup (2 minutes)

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
start.bat
```
Wait for: `Starting server on 0.0.0.0:8005`

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to: **http://localhost:8005**

---

## Using Local Video Streaming (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Click "Browse Local Folder"
Look for the new button in the header (hard drive icon)

### Step 2: Enter Folder Path
Examples:
- `C:\Users\YourName\Videos\MyProject`
- `D:\Videos\Research\Glassblowing`

Click **"Browse Folder"**

### Step 3: Add Your 11GB Video
- Videos appear instantly with file sizes
- Click **"Add"** next to your video
- **Registration takes <1 second** (no upload!)

### Step 4: Annotate Normally
- Select video from dropdown
- Streams perfectly (HTTP Range Requests)
- Recording, transcription, extended transcripts all work
- Seek anywhere - no lag!

---

## Testing Before Presentation

### Quick Test
```bash
python test_local_streaming.py
```

Follow prompts to test:
1. Server health
2. Folder browsing
3. Video registration
4. HTTP streaming

### Manual Browser Test
1. Start server
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Load a local video
5. Seek around in the video
6. **Look for**: `206 Partial Content` responses with `Range` headers

## Demo Flow for Presentation

### The Story
> "I have an 11GB expert glassblowing demonstration video. I need to annotate it today for my presentation, but I don't have Google Drive space and uploading would take hours."

### The Solution (Live Demo)
1. **Show the problem**: "This is an 11GB file" (show file explorer)
2. **Click Browse Local**: "Instead of uploading, I browse locally"
3. **Enter path**: Type the path, click Browse
4. **Instant registration**: "Look - registered in less than 1 second!"
5. **Select and stream**: Video loads and plays perfectly
6. **Make annotation**: Record elicitation, show transcription
7. **Seek around**: "Notice how it seeks instantly? That's HTTP Range Requests"

### Key Points to Emphasize
- ✅ **Zero upload time** - perfect for tight deadlines
- ✅ **Standard technology** - same as YouTube/Netflix streaming
- ✅ **No cloud dependency** - works offline
- ✅ **Production ready** - proper HTTP 206 Partial Content
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - uploaded videos still work

## Technical Architecture (If Asked)

### Backend
- **Range Request Support**: HTTP 206 Partial Content
- **No File Copying**: Stores path only (11 bytes vs 11GB)
- **Efficient Streaming**: Reads 8KB chunks on demand

### Database
- `is_local=1` flag marks local videos
- `source_type="local"` differentiates from uploaded/gdrive
- Auto-migration on startup

### Frontend
- Reuses existing video player
- No changes needed (browser handles Range requests)
- New modal for folder browsing

---

## Troubleshooting for Demo

### If Server Won't Start
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

### If Video Won't Play
1. Check file path is correct
2. Verify file exists: Open File Explorer and navigate to it
3. Check console for errors (F12)

### If Folder Browse Shows "Not Found"
- Use absolute path (full path starting with drive letter)
- Backslashes work: `C:\Videos`
- Forward slashes work too: `C:/Videos`

---

## Backup Plan

If live demo fails, have screenshots ready showing:
1. The "Browse Local Folder" button
2. The folder browser with 11GB video listed
3. Instant registration (<1 second)
4. Video playing with timeline
5. Network tab showing 206 responses

---

## After Presentation

### Documentation
- `LOCAL_VIDEO_STREAMING.md` - Full technical documentation
- `test_local_streaming.py` - Automated test script
- This file - Quick reference

### Code Changes Summary
- **3 files modified**: `models.py`, `main.py`, `app.js`
- **~200 lines added** (backend + frontend + CSS)
- **Zero breaking changes** - fully backward compatible

## Questions You Might Get

**Q: "Is this secure?"**
A: "For local use, yes. For production, add authentication like existing features."

**Q: "What about network drives?"**
A: "Works with mapped drives (Z:\, etc). SMB/NFS paths would need testing."

**Q: "Can it handle even bigger files?"**
A: "Yes! HTTP Range Requests are designed for this. No size limit."

**Q: "What if the file moves?"**
A: "Just like a shortcut - if the file moves, re-register it. We track the path."

**Q: "Does this work on Mac/Linux?"**
A: "Yes! Just use Unix paths like `/home/user/videos/file.mp4`"

## Good Luck! 🍀

Remember: The key selling point is **instant registration of an 11GB file** that would otherwise take 30+ minutes to upload. This is a huge productivity win for researchers working with large video datasets.

Show confidence - this is production-ready streaming technology! 🎥✨
